#XML Parser

This is an XML Parser written in Java for a second year university project. The task was to create an XML Parser that would read in an XML file, store it in memory and then print it out with the same formatting as it went in with. 

I was not allowed to use the Java collection classes. 

As an extention I decided to use the Swing GUI toolkit to make this into a better looking application. 

##To do List
---
- Extract all the 'name' and 'rs' elements and record them with no duplicated. Then assign each one a unique key ad put the key back into the xml attribute. This should also be sent to a file called NameBase.txt
- Include an appropriate revision line within teiHeader to indicate changes (use swing to change options)
- Any Additions
